# compoundor-js

A simple implementation of a auto-compounder bot for the revert Auto-Compounder smart contract.

## Getting Started

Before running the script create a .env config file with the keys from .env.example

You need to configure a private key to an account which will do the autocompounding (and needs some funds to pay for the gas fee of auto-compounding).

Then:

```sh
npm install
node index.js
```
